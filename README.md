### - Architecture :
   I'm using the [Flutter clean architecture](https://betterprogramming.pub/flutter-clean-architecture-test-driven-development-practical-guide-445f388e8604) The clean architecture will divide the Flutter project into 3 main layers, namely :
   1- Data
   2- Domain
   3- Presentation
   So please for more information check it out [here]((https://betterprogramming.pub/flutter-clean-architecture-test-driven-development-practical-guide-445f388e8604)).
